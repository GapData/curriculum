    Learn the absolute essentials of data science as quickly as possible,
    so that you can start performing authentic (if simple) analyses.

- title: Exploratory data analysis
  desc: >
    Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
    visualisation. This week you'll practice those tools by using them for
    EDA (exploratory data analysis), and diving into some of the details of
    dplyr and ggplot2 that we elided last week.

    Here we apply these tools to small (in-memory) data, but they're still
    useful when you have big (out-of-memory) data. That's because a powerful
    strategy for working with big data is to make it small with some combination
    of subetting, summarising, or sampling.
  units:
  - EDA
  - dplyr-details
  - ggplot2-details
  challenges:
  - TODO. Baby names. geom_line + grouping. How to summarise? Include
      mutate that adds some interesting variables.
  - diamonds-3

    So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
    happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a
    flat files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on
    some important theory about the R's data structures.
