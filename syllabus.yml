    Learn the absolute essentials of data science as quickly as possible,
    so that you can start performing authentic (if simple) analyses.

- title: Exploratory data analysis
  desc: >
    Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
    visualisation. This week you'll practice those tools by using them for
    EDA (exploratory data analysis), and diving into some of the details of
    dplyr and ggplot2 that we elided last week.
  units:
  - eda
  - ggplot2-theory
  - data-summaries
  - data-transformations
  challenges:
  - TODO. Baby names. geom_line + grouping. How to summarise? Include
      mutate that adds some interesting variables.
  - diamonds-3

    So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
    happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a
    flat files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on
    some important theory about the R's data structures.
  units:
  - tidy
  - import
  - missing-values
  - data-structures

- title: Functions and iteration

    R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming
    will give you powerful tools for automating your work. This week, you'll
    learn some alternatives to copy and paste.

  # - vector-functions
  # - hierarchical-data
  # - report-generation

- title: Date/times and relational data
  desc: >
    This week we'll learn how to handle date/time data, and multiple
    related table (relational data). This will allow us to fully explore
    the datasets in nycflights13, and start to learn how weather is related
    to flight delays.
  # units:
  # - date-time
  # - relational-data

- title: Strings and factors
  desc: >
    There are two important types of variable that we haven't covered in
    detail yet: strings and factors. You'll also learn about regular expression
    which are a special, compact, language for describing patterns in strings.
