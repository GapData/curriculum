    Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
    visualisation. This week you'll first learn about the overall philosophy of
    exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dive into the details of visual
    summaries and transformations.

    This week is a grab bag of important data types and tools that will let you
    explore more datasets. You'll get a broad overview of the most
    important augmented vectors (date-times, strings, and factors),
    learn more about tidy tibbles, master two important tools for tidying
    messy data, and learn about joins, which allow you to combine multiple
    datasets.
  units:
  - datetime-basics

    So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
    happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a
    flat files on disk, and more skills for working with data stored as
    text. We'll also give you some skills for annotating and labelling your
    plots

  - parse-vector

- title: Functions and iteration
  slug: programming
  desc: >
    R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming
    will give you powerful tools for automating your work. We've touched on
    basic functions already, but this week, we'll focus on them, learning
    important skills for automating your workflow.

  - vectors
  - vector-functions
  - lists

    A grab bag of things that we probably should've told you about previously
    but somehow slipped Hadley's mind.

- title: Modelling
  slug: modelling
  desc: >
    Models are a useful tool for partitioning data into structure and
    what remains (the residuals). Here you'll learn the basics of modelling
    and how you can apply them to make sense of complex datasets.

  units:
  - model-basics
  - model-vis
  - model-multivariate

- title: List columns
  slug: list-cols
  desc: >
    Data frames are an extremely useful data structure, but so far have been
    limited to containing atomic vectors. However, data frames can also
    contain lists, and since you can put anything in a list, these allow
    you to extend the data frame to contain any data structure. Here you'll
    learn the principles and then see two applications.

  - list-cols
  - model-many
