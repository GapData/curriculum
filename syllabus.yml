- title: Exploratory data analysis
  desc: >
    Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
    visualisation. This week you'll first learn about the overall philosophy of
    exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dive into the details of visual
    summaries and transformations.

    This week is a grab bag of important data types and tools that will let you
    explore more datasets. You'll get a broad overview of the most
    important augmented vectors (date-times, strings, and factors),
    learn more about tidy tibbles, master two important tools for tidying
    messy data, and learn about joins, which allow you to combine multiple
    datasets.

- title: Deepening your data skills
  desc: >
    So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
    happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a
    flat files on disk, and more skills for working with data stored as
    text. We'll also give you some skills for annotating and labelling your
    plots

- title: Functions and iteration
  desc: >
    R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming
    will give you powerful tools for automating your work. We've touched on
    basic functions already, but this week, we'll focus on them, learning
    important skills for automating your workflow.

- title: Strings and factors
  desc: >
    There are two important types of variable that we haven't covered in
    detail yet: strings and factors. You'll also learn about regular expression
    which are a special, compact, language for describing patterns in strings.
