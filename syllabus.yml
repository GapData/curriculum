    Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
    visualisation. This week you'll first learn about the overall philosophy of
    exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dive into the details of visual
    summaries and transformations.

- title: Care and feeding of tibbles
  desc: >
    So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
    happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a
    flat files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on
    some important theory about the R's data structures.

- title: Functions and iteration
  desc: >
    R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming
    will give you powerful tools for automating your work. We've touched on
    basic functions already, but this week, we'll focus on them, learning
    important skills for automating your workflow.

- title: Date/times and relational data
  desc: >
    This week we'll learn how to handle date/time data, and multiple
    related table (relational data). This will allow us to fully explore
    the datasets in nycflights13, and start to learn how weather is related
    to flight delays.
  # units:
  # - date-time
  # - relational-data

- title: Strings and factors
  desc: >
    There are two important types of variable that we haven't covered in
    detail yet: strings and factors. You'll also learn about regular expression
    which are a special, compact, language for describing patterns in strings.
