# Data challenge lab

This repository contains the [draft syllabus](syllabus/) for the [Standford Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu) Spring 2017 class.

Each week is defined by a common theme which is realised in one or more units, and a handful of data challeges. Each unit captures a small chunk of knowledge given by the readings and tested in the exercises. Many units also have supplemental readings which provide additional colour.

(Currently the units are rather coarse; over time they will get finer and finer.)
