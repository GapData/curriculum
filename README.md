# Data challenge lab

This is the draft syllabus for the [Standford Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu) Spring 2017 class. It is a 10 week course broken down into smaller [units](units/) and challenges. The syllabus and yaml are stored as yaml files, which an R script then converts into markdown files for each week (as well as an overall storyboard view.)
