# Data challenge lab

This repository contains the [draft syllabus](docs/) for the [Standford Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu) Spring 2017 class.

The curriculum is composed of small __units__. A unit is composed of a set of guided readings and a handful of small exercises (in an `.Rmd`) designed to test that you've understood the material.

These small units are composed in several ways:

* As a temporal __syllabus__, an ordering designed to work well for the 
  "average" student. The syllabus also contains bigger integrative challenges 
  and supplemental readings that provide extra colour.
