title: Care and feeding of tibbles

  So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
  happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a
  flat files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on
  some important theory about the R's data structures.

      An example, by Jeff Leek, of when tidy data isn't as useful as
      a non-tidy structure.

      This article lays out more of the details behind tidy data, and works
      through a few more case studies. However, it uses a previous iteration
      of the tools, using reshape2 instead of tidyr. To see the code translated
      into tidyr, read the
      [tidy data vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).

    Now that we're at week 3, it's worth reviewing how you're organising your
    code. Good organisation is critical now and in the future, because it's
    much easier to re-solve a problem you've seen before if you can easily
    locate the code you used to solve it the last time.
