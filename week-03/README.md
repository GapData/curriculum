# Care and feeding of tibbles

So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__ happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a flat files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on some important theory about the R's data structures.

## Project organisation

Now that we're at week 3, it's worth reviewing how you're organising your code. Good organisation is critical now and in the future, because it's much easier to re-solve a problem you've seen before if you can easily locate the code you used to solve it the last time.
