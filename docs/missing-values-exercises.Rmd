```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

1.  If `x` is a numeric vector containing some missing values, what does
    `sum(x == NA)` return. Why? What does `mean(is.na(x))` return? Why?
    

1.  What happens to flights with missing departure delays in the following
    filter statement?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(nycflights13)
    
    flights %>% 
      filter(dep_delay > 120)
    ```

1.  Compare and contrast the ways that missing values appear in the following
    plot. Why does missingness in `x`, `y`, and `z` display differently?
    
    ```{r}
    df <- tribble(
      ~ x, ~ y, ~ z,
      "a",   3,   2,
      "b",  NA,   5,
      "c",   4,  NA,
      NA,    6,   6
    )
    ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
      geom_point(aes(colour = z))
    ```
