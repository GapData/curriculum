# Data manipulation basics
<small>(Builds on: [Data basics](data-basics.md))</small>

Some basic data manipulation is essential for many visualisations. Here you'll the learn the most important dplyr functions: `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `group_by()` + `summarise()`.

## Readings

Skip through this chapter of R4DS focussing on `filter()`, `mutate()` and
`group_by()` + `summarise()`.
