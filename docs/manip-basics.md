# Data manipulation basics

Some basic data manipulation is essential for many visualisations. Here you'll
the learn the most important dplyr functions: `filter()`, `mutate()`, and
`group_by()` + `summarise()`.

## Readings

Skip through this chapter of R4DS focussing on `filter()`, `mutate()` and
`group_by()` + `summarise()`.

  * [Filter rows with filter()](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter) [r4ds-5.2]

  * [Add new variables with mutate()](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#add-new-variables-with-mutate) [r4ds-5.5]

  * [Grouped summaries with summarise()](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-summaries-with-summarise) [r4ds-5.6]

  * [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) [cheatsheets-data-wrangling].
    The cheatsheet includes a list of the most important summary functions.
    Refer to it when you forget.


## Exercises

1.  Find all flights that:

    1.  Had an depature delay of two or more hours
    2.  Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
    3.  Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

2.  Compute the departure delay yourself by computing the difference between `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time`. (Hint: convert to "decimal" time = `hour + minutes / 60`).

3.  Which destination has the highest average delay? Which destination that had over 100 flights has highest average delay?
