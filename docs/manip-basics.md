# Data science basics

Some basic data manipulation is essential for many visualisations. Here you'll
the learn the most important dplyr functions: `filter()`, `mutate()`, and
`group_by()` + `summarise()`.

## Exercises

1.  Find all flights that:

    1.  Had an depature delay of two or more hours
    2.  Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
    3.  Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

2.  Compute the departure delay yourself by computing the difference between `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time`. (Hint: convert to "decimal" time = `hour + minutes / 60`).

3.  Which destination has the highest average delay? Which destination that had over 100 flights has highest average delay?
