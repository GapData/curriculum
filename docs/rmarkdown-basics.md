# RMarkdown basics

Experience the full data science workflow by creating an RMarkdown file that
includes prose and code. __Knit__ the file to create intermingle your text and
the results of the code. This is an authentic workflow: the only difference
between this and what you'll use as a data scientist is that in this class
you'll always show your code so we can give you feedback on the results _and_
the process.
