## Exploratory data analysis {#eda}

Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
visualisation. This week you'll first learn about the overall philosophy of
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dive into the details of visual summaries
and transformations.

1. [Missing values](missing-values.md)
1. [The grammar of graphics](vis-theory.md)
1. [Grouped summaries](vis-summaries.md)
1. [Visual transformations](vis-transformation.md)
1. [Getting help](getting-help.md)

## Data essentials {#data-essentials}

This week is a grab bag of important data types and tools that will let you
explore more datasets. You'll get a broad overview of the most important
augmented vectors (date-times, strings, and factors), learn more about tidy
tibbles, master two important tools for tidying messy data, and learn about
joins, which allow you to combine multiple datasets.

### Units

1. [Date/time basics](datetime-basics.md)
1. [String basics](string-basics.md)
1. [Factor basics](factor-basics.md)
1. [Tidy tibbles](tidy-tibbles.md)

## Deepening your data skills {#deepening}

So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a flat
files on disk, and more skills for working with data stored as text. We'll also
give you some skills for annotating and labelling your plots

### Units

1. [Parsing vectors](parse-vector.md)
1. [Parsing files](parse-file.md)
1. [Regular expressions](regexps.md)
1. [Separate and unite](separate-unite.md)
1. [Labelling your graphics](vis-labelling.md)
1. [Perception](vis-perception.md)

### Supplemental readings

## Functions and iteration {#programming}

R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming will give
you powerful tools for automating your work. We've touched on basic functions
already, but this week, we'll focus on them, learning important skills for
automating your workflow.

### Units

1. [Vectors](vectors.md)
1. [Vector functions](vector-functions.md)
1. [Lists](lists.md)
1. [Iteration](iteration.md)
1. [Generating multiple reports](report-generation.md)
1. [Reprexes](reprexes.md)
1. [Exporting data](export.md)
