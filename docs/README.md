# Syllabus

## Foundations

Learn the absolute essentials of data science as quickly as possible, so that
you can start performing authentic (if simple) analyses.

### Units

1. [setup](setup.md)
1. [data-basics](data-basics.md)
1. [vis-basics](vis-basics.md)
1. [manip-basics](manip-basics.md)
1. [rmarkdown-basics](rmarkdown-basics.md)

### Challenges

1.  diamonds-1
1.  diamonds-2
1.  TODO. practice whole process including sync to github


## Exploratory data analysis

Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
visualisation. This week you'll first learn about the overall philosophy of EDA
(exploratory data analysis), and then dive into the details of data summaries
and transformations.

### Units

1. [eda](eda.md)
1. [missing-values](missing-values.md)
1. [vis-theory](vis-theory.md)
1. [vis-summaries](vis-summaries.md)
1. [vis-transformations](vis-transformations.md)

### Challenges

1.  diamonds-3


## Care and feeding of tibbles

So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a flat
files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on some
important theory about the R's data structures.

### Units

1. [tidy](tidy.md)
1. [import](import.md)
1. [data-structures](data-structures.md)
1. [function-summary](function-summary.md)


## Functions and iteration

R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming will give
you powerful tools for automating your work. We've touched on basic functions
already, but this week, we'll focus on them, learning important skills for
automating your workflow.


## Date/times and relational data

This week we'll learn how to handle date/time data, and multiple related table
(relational data). This will allow us to fully explore the datasets in
nycflights13, and start to learn how weather is related to flight delays.


## Strings and factors

There are two important types of variable that we haven't covered in detail
yet: strings and factors. You'll also learn about regular expression which are
a special, compact, language for describing patterns in strings.

### Challenges

1.  neiss


## Modelling




## Hierarchical data with purrr




## Text data with tidytext




## Spatial data with sf
