Date/time data includes dates, date-times, and times, but we'll mostly
focus on dates and date-times. This unit gives you the basic tools you'll
need to filter and summarise temporal data.

## Readings

  * [Introduction](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html#introduction-10) [r4ds-16.1]

  * [Creating date/times](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html#creating-datetimes) [r4ds-16.2]

  * [Date-time components](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html#date-time-components) [r4ds-16.3].
    Read only ยง16.3.1 (getting components) and ยง16.3.2 (rounding). These are
    both important for when you want to group by and summarise longer time
    periods.

  * [Scales, axes and legends](http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.stanford.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4_6) [ggplot2-6].
    Read only ยง6.6.1 focussing on date/time scales. This will allow you to
    optimise the visualisation of date/time data, if needed.
