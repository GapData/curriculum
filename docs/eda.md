# EDA

Exploratory data analysis is partly a set of techniques, but is mostly a
mindset: you want to remain open to what the data is telling you. You'll learn
the techniques in the readings, and then practice the mindset in class and in
the challenges.

## Readings

The following sections give you an overview of the most important tools for
EDA. (Note that you can skip Section 7.4: we'll come back to missing values
next week.)

  * [Introduction](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#introduction-3) [r4ds-7.1]

  * [Questions](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#questions) [r4ds-7.2]

  * [Variation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#variation) [r4ds-7.3]

  * [Covariation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#covariation) [r4ds-7.5]

Now is a good time to learn a bit more about the underlying theory of ggplot2.
Read these two short chapters to familiarise yourself with the theory and learn
some useful vocabulary.

  * [Mastering the grammar](http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.stanford.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4_4) [ggplot2-4]

  * [Build a plot layer by layer](http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.stanford.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4_5) [ggplot2-5]
