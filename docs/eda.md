# Exploratory data

Exploratory data analysis is partly a set of techniques, but is mostly a
mindset: you want to remain open to what the data is telling you.

## Readings

The following sections give you an overview of the most important tools for
EDA. (Note that you can skip Section 7.4: we'll come back to missing values
later)

1.  Visualise the distribution of `diamonds$price`. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.) Describe your findings and brainstorm possible explanations.

2.  Visualise the distribution of `diamonds$price` by `diamonds$cut`. Use at least three different approaches. What did you learn?
