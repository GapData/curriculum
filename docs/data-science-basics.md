# Data science basics
(estimated duration: 90 mins)

Data transformation and visualisation are the most important tools for data
science. You'll learn them first using tidy data (column = variable, row =
case) that we give you. Later, you'll learn how to apply them to your own data.

    back and read in detail when you actually need to use them.


## Exercises

1.  Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this plot? Why are the points not blue?
    
    ```R
    ggplot(data = mpg) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
1.  What's gone wrong with this plot? Why is there only one boxplot?
    
    ```R
    ggplot(data = mpg) +
      geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = displ))
    ```
    
1.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous?
    Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these
    aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
    
1.  How does engine displacement vary with number of cylinders?
    Draw a plot with ggplot2. Compute a numeric summary with dplyr.
    What are the pros and cons of a plot vs. a numeric summary?
    
1.  Create a new variable that gives the displacement per cylinder.
    How does it vary across classes. Visualise with ggplot2.
    
1.  How does the relationship between `displ` and `cyl` vary with `drv`?
    There are a handful of cars with 5 cylinders. Remove them before drawing
    your plots.
    
    Show three plots and write a one paragrah summary. Describe three
    improvements that you'd like to make to your plots, but you don't know how.
