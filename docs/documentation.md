# Documentation
<small>(Builds on: [Setup](setup.md))</small>

R comes with rich built-in documentation that you can access by typing
`?` before the name of a function.  The documentation isn't always
aimed at newcomers, and may use terminology that you're not familiar with.
But don't despair! Ignore what you don't understand, and persevere.
Often you'll find what you need in the examples at the bottom of the help
page.

There are three commands in R that you should be familiar with:

* `?function_name` opens the help for `function_name()`.

* `help(package = "package_name")` lists all the functions available in
  a package with links to their help pages.

* `browseVignettes(package = "package_name")` lists all the "vignettes"
  (long form documentation) available for a package.

There are also some useful websites that you'll learn about below.

## Readings

  * [tidyverse.org](http://tidyverse.org).
    This is a work in progress, but lists websites for individual packages
    within the tidyverse.

  * [rdocumentation.org](https://www.rdocumentation.org).
    This website contains the documentation for the vast majority of R packages
    with a searchable index.
