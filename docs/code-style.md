# Code style

Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial. It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation sure make things easier to read!

## Readings

  * [Style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
    The specific style you follow is not as important as picking a consistent
    style and sticking to it. When you're working with others, it's a really
    good idea to share a common style so that everyone can easily read and
    write the code. In this class, we'll use the style guide from "Advanced R".
