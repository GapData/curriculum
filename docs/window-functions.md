# Window functions
<small>(Builds on: [Data manipulation basics](manip-basics.md))</small>

Window functions are an important family of functions; they're analogous
to the summary functions that you already know about, but are work with
grouped `mutate()`s and `filter()`s, rather than grouped `summarise()`s.
