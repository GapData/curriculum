# Data science workflow
(estimated duration: 45 mins)

Experience the full data science workflow by creating an RMarkdown file,
running some R code, and uploading the results to GitHub. This is an authentic
workflow: the only difference between this and what you'll use as a data
scientist is that in this class you'll always show your code so we can give you
feedback on the results _and_ the process.
