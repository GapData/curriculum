# R Markdown presentations
<small>(Builds on: [R Markdown basics](rmarkdown-basics.md))</small>

We only touched briefly on RMarkdown's capability to produce different
forms of output. In this class you have used `github_document` which
makes it very easy to publish your results on GitHub. The are two
formats that you should know about:

* `html_document`: this produces a stand-alone HTML document that you
  can easily share over email

* ?????: this produces a HTML presentation which you can use when you
  need to present your data to a live audience

* `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard`: this makes dashboards which can be
  convenient way to lay out multiple plots and tables on a single
  screen.
