# Spatial visualisation
<small>(Builds on: [Spatial data basics](spatial-basics.md))</small>

This currently requires the development version of ggplot2. You can
install it from GitHub by using the devtools package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
```

(If you have an issues during the install, restart R so that you
have a clean session. Installing ggplot2 is tricky if you already have it
loaded!)
