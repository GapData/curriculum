It is possible to understand some models (particularly popular statistical
models) by learning how to interpret their coefficients. We're not going
to take that approach here for two reasons:

* It requires many months of study to interpret the coefficients of even
  fairly simple model classes like logistic regression or survival analysis.

* Many modern classes of model have large numbers coefficients,
  which are hard to interpret.

Instead, we'll understand a model by looking at it's predictions. This
doesn't cover every possible model (because not every model makes predictions)
but it does cover a very wide class, including most models in statistics
and machine learning.

In this unit, you'll learn the basic approach, visualising a very simple
model.
