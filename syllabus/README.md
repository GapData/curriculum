# Weekly syllabus

*   __Week 1__: [Foundations](week-01.md)

    Learn the absolute essentials of data science as quickly as possible, so
    that you can start performing authentic (if simple) analyses.


*   __Week 2__: [Exploratory data analysis](week-02.md)

    Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
    visualisation. This week you'll practice those tools by using them for EDA
    (exploratory data analysis), and diving into some of the details of dplyr
    and ggplot2 that we elided last week. Here we apply these tools to small
    (in-memory) data, but they're still useful when you have big
    (out-of-memory) data. That's because a powerful strategy for working with
    big data is to make it small with some combination of subetting,
    summarising, or sampling.


*   __Week 3__: [Care and feeding of tibbles](week-03.md)

    So far you've used tidy data that we've provided you. This will __never__
    happen in real life, so this week you'll learn how to load data from a flat
    files on disk, and get your data into a tidy form. We'll also touch on some
    important theory about the R's data structures.


*   __Week 4__: [Functions and iteration](week-04.md)

    R is a programming language, and mastering the basics of programming will
    give you powerful tools for automating your work. This week, you'll learn
    some alternatives to copy and paste.


*   __Week 5__: [Date/times and relational data](week-05.md)

    This week we'll learn how to handle date/time data, and multiple related
    table (relational data). This will allow us to fully explore the datasets
    in nycflights13, and start to learn how weather is related to flight
    delays.


*   __Week 6__: [Strings and factors](week-06.md)

    There are two important types of variable that we haven't covered in detail
    yet: strings and factors. You'll also learn about regular expression which
    are a special, compact, language for describing patterns in strings.


*   __Week 7__: [Modelling](week-07.md)




*   __Week 8__: [Hierarchical data with purrr](week-08.md)




*   __Week 9__: [Text data with tidytext](week-09.md)




*   __Week 10__: [Spatial data with sf](week-10.md)
