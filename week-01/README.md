# Foundations

Learn the absolute essentials of data science as quickly as possible, so that you can start performing authentic (if simple) analyses.

## Setup

Ensure that you have all the tools to need for this class.

### Readings

### Supplemental readings

* [Getting Started with R Markdown.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/)

## Data science basics

Data transformation and visualisation are the most important data science tools. You'll learn them first using tidy data (column = variable, row = case) that we provide.

## Learning workflow

You will get the most out of this class if you learn some tools and techniques for exploratory reading, getting help, and recording what you've learned.

### Readings

* Reading. Strategies for effective reading, integrating information from multiple places, following links, accepting incompleteness. What is tacit knowledge, how to recognise when you’re missing it, and what to do about it.
* Asking questions. How to effectively ask questions so that we can answer them effectively. How to title issues, what is reprex (morally), using reprex package, code formatting for readability etc... Using google.
* Note taking. How do you record what you've learned so you can reuse later (copy-and-paste from previous work as a skill). Using README's in github.
* [Common problems](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#common-problems)
