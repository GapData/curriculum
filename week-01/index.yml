    You will get the most out of this class if you learn some tools and
    techniques for exploratory reading, getting help, and recording
    what you've learned.
  readings:
    - todo: Reading. Strategies for effective reading, integrating information
        from multiple places, following links, accepting incompleteness.
        What is tacit knowledge, how to recognise when youâ€™re missing it,
        and what to do about it.
    - todo: Asking questions. How to effectively ask questions so that we can
        answer them effectively. How to title issues, what is reprex (morally),
        using reprex package, code formatting for readability etc...
        Using google.
    - todo: Note taking. How do you record what you've learned so you can
        reuse later (copy-and-paste from previous work as a skill). Using
        README's in github.
