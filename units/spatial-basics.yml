desc: "\nSpatial packages\n----------------\n\nIn R, there are two main lineages of
  tools for dealing with spatial data: sp and sf.\n\n-   sp has been around for a
  while (the first release was in 2005), and it has a rich ecosystem of tools built
  around it. However, it uses a rather complicated object design which makes it hard
  to use.\n\n-   sf is newer (first released in October 2016!) so it doesn't have
  such a rich ecosystem. However, it's much easier to use and fits in very naturally
  with the tidyverse, and the ecosystem around it will grow rapidly.\n\nIn this class,
  we're going to use sf, so start by installing it:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"sf\")\n```\n\nLoading
  data\n------------\n\nTo read spatial data in R, use `read_sf()`. The following
  example reads an example dataset built into the sf package:\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n#
  The counties of North Carolina\nnc <- read_sf(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package
  = \"sf\"), \n  quiet = TRUE,  \n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n```\n\nI recommend
  always setting `quiet = TRUE` and `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.\n\nHere we're loading
  from **shapefile** which is the way spatial data is most commonly stored. Typically
  you'll have four files:\n\n-   `.shp` contains the geometry, and `.shx` contains
  an index into that geometry.\n\n-   `.dbf` contains the other columns in the data
  frame\n\n-   `.prf` gives the coordinate system and projection information. You'll
  learn more about that shortly.\n\n`read_sf()` can read in the majority of spatial
  file formats, so don't worry if your data is in this format.\n\nConverting data\n---------------\n\nIf
  you get a spatial object created by the sp package, us `st_as_sf()` to convert it
  to sf. For example, you can take data from the maps package (included in base R)
  and convert it to sf:\n\n``` r\nlibrary(maps)\n#> \n#> Attaching package: 'maps'\n#>
  The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n#> \n#>     map\nnz_map <-
  map(\"nz\", plot = FALSE)\nnz_sf <- st_as_sf(nz_map)\n```\n\nData structure\n--------------\n\n`nc`
  is a data frame, and not a tibble, so when printing, it's a good idea to use `head()`
  so you only see the first few rows:\n\n``` r\nhead(nc)\n#> Simple feature collection
  with 6 features and 14 fields\n#> geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n#> dimension:      XY\n#>

  data frame, with one exception: the **geometry** column. This column contains simple
  \"features\", a standard way of representing two dimesional geometries like points,
  lines, polygons, multilines, and multipolygons. Multilines and multipolygons are
  nededed to represent geographic phenomena like a river with multiple branches, or
  a state made up of multiple islands.\n\n``` r\nnc$geometry\n#> Geometry set for

  can get a simple visualisation use `plot()`. In the next unit, we'll learn how to
  use ggplot2 for more complex data visualisations, but this simple plot is a great
  diagnostic tool\n\n``` r\nplot(nc$geometry)\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-markdown_github/nc-plot-1.png)\n\nManipulating
  with dplyr\n-----------------------\n\nSince an sf object is just a data frame,
  you can manipulate it with dplyr. The following example gives you a taste:\n\n```
  r\nnz_sf %>%\n  mutate(area = as.numeric(st_area(geometry))) %>%\n  filter(area
  > 1e10)\n#>                         geometry            ID         area\n#> 1 POLYGON((172.74333190918
  -3... North.Island  113469632351\n#> 2 POLYGON((172.639053344727 -... South.Island
  \ 150444467051\n```\n\n(`st_area()` returns an object with units, which is annoying
  to work with. I used `as.numeric()` to convert to a regular numeric vector)\n\nGeometry\n--------\n\nThe
  geometry column is a list-column, and it's worthwhile to pull out one piece so you
  can see what's going on under the hood:\n\n``` r\nstr(nc$geometry[[1]])\n#> List
  of 1\n#>  $ :List of 1\n#>   ..$ : num [1:27, 1:2] -81.5 -81.5 -81.6 -81.6 -81.7
  ...\n#>  - attr(*, \"class\")= chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"MULTIPOLYGON\" \"sfg\"\nplot(nc$geometry[[1]])\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)\n\nThis
  is list of lists of matrices:\n\n-   The top-level list has one element for each
  \"landmass\" in the county. We can find a more interesting case:\n\n    ``` r\n
  \   n <- nc$geometry %>% map_int(length)\n    table(n)\n    #> n\n    #>  1  2  3
  \n    #> 94  4  2\n\n    interesting <- nc$geometry[n == 3][[1]]\n    plot(interesting)\n
  \   ```\n\n    ![](spatial-basics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)\n\n
  \   ``` r\n    str(interesting)\n    #> List of 3\n    #>  $ :List of 1\n    #>
  \  ..$ : num [1:26, 1:2] -76 -76 -76 -76 -76.1 ...\n    #>  $ :List of 1\n    #>
  \  ..$ : num [1:7, 1:2] -76 -76 -75.9 -75.9 -76 ...\n    #>  $ :List of 1\n    #>
  \  ..$ : num [1:5, 1:2] -75.9 -75.9 -75.8 -75.8 -75.9 ...\n    #>  - attr(*, \"class\")=
  chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"MULTIPOLYGON\" \"sfg\"\n    ```\n\n-   The second-level list
  is not used in this dataset, but is needed when you have a landmass that contains
  an lake. (Or a landmass that contains an lake which has an island which has a pond).\n\n-
  \  Each row of the matrix gives the location of a point on the boundary of the polygon.\n\nCoordinate
  system\n-----------------\n\nTo correctly plot spatial data, you need know exactly
  what the positions mean, you need to know what the **coordinate reference system**
  is. Often spatial data is described in terms of latitude and longitude. You can
  check this with `st_is_longlat()`:\n\n``` r\nst_is_longlat(nc)\n#> [1] TRUE\n```\n\nYou
  might think that if you know the latitude and longitude of a point, you know exactly
  where it is on the Earth. However, things are not quite so simple, because latitude
  and longitude assume that the Earth is a smooth ellipsoid, which is not true. Because
  different approximations to the sphere work better in differently places, most countries
  have their own approximation: this is called the **datum**.\n\nTake two minutes
  and watch this simple explanation of the datum: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKGlMp__jog>\n\nTo
  get the datum and other coordinate system metadata, use `st_crs()`:\n\n``` r\nst_crs(nc)\n#>
  $epsg\n#> [1] 4267\n#> \n#> $proj4string\n#> [1] \"+proj=longlat +datum=NAD27 +no_defs\"\n#>
  \n#> attr(,\"class\")\n#> [1] \"crs\"\n```\n\nHere the datum is \"NAD27\", the [North
  American Datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Datum) of 1927 (NAD27)\n\nIn
  this class, you won't have to worry too much about the datum as sf and ggplot2 will
  take care of the details for you. But it's good to know why it exists and how to
  identify it if something goes wrong.\n"
