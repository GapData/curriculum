title: Visualising models
theme: model

desc: |
  It is possible to understand some models (particularly popular statistical
  models) by learning how to interpret their coefficients. We're not going
  to take that approach here for two reasons:

  * It requires many months of study to interpret the coefficients of even
    fairly simple model classes like logistic regression or survival analysis.

  * Many modern classes of model have large numbers coefficients,
    which are hard to interpret.

  Instead, we'll understand a model by looking at it's predictions. This
  doesn't cover every possible model (because not every model makes predictions)
  but it does cover a very wide class, including most models in statistics
  and machine learning.

  In this unit, you'll learn the basic approach, visualising a very simple
  model.
