title: Data science basics
desc: >
  Data transformation and visualisation are the most important tools for
  data science. You'll learn them first using tidy data (column = variable,
  row = case) that we give you. Later, you'll learn how to apply them to
  your own data.

    Skim this chapter so you're aware of the most important ggplot2 tools.
    Come back and read in detail when you actually need to use them.

exercises:
- |
  Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this plot? Why are the points not blue?

  ```R
  ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
  ```

- |
  What's gone wrong with this plot? Why is there only one boxplot?

  ```R
  ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = displ))
  ```

- |
  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous?
  Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these
  aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

- |
  How does engine displacement vary with number of cylinders?
  Draw a plot with ggplot2. Compute a numeric summary with dplyr.
  What are the pros and cons of a plot vs. a numeric summary?

- |
  Create a new variable that gives the displacement per cylinder.
  How does it vary across classes. Visualise with ggplot2.

- |
  How does the relationship between `displ` and `cyl` vary with `drv`?
  There are a handful of cars with 5 cylinders. Remove them before drawing
  your plots.

  Show three plots and write a one paragrah summary. Describe three
  improvements that you'd like to make to your plots, but you don't know how.
