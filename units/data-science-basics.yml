  Data transformation and visualisation are the most important data science
  tools. You'll learn them first using tidy data (column = variable, row =
  case) that we provide.

    Skim this chapter so you're aware of the most important ggplot2 tools.
    Come back and read in detail when you actually need to use them.

exercises:
- |
  Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this plot? Why are the points not blue?

  ```{r}
  ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
  ```

- |
  What's gone wrong with this plot? Why is there only one histogram?

  ```{r}
  ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = displ))
  ```

- |
  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous?
  Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these
  aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

- |
  How does engine displacement vary with number of cylinders?
  Draw a plot with ggplot2. Compute a numeric summary with ggplot2.
  Create a new variable that gives the displacement per cylinder.
  Visualise with ggplot2.

- |
  How does the relationship between `displ` and `cyl` vary with `drv`?
  Show three plots and write a one paragrah summary. There are a handful of
  cars with 5 cylinders. Remove them before drawing your plots.
  Describe three things that you'd like to do to improve your plots but you
  don't know how yet.
