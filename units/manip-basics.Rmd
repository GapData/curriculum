1. Find all flights that:

    1. Had an depature delay of two or more hours
    1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
    1. Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

1.  Compute the departure delay yourself by computing the difference
    between `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time`. (Hint: convert to "decimal"
    time = `hour + minutes / 60`). 
   
1.  Which destination has the highest average delay? Which destination that had
    over 100 flights has highest average delay?
