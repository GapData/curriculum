  `tidyr::separate()` is a useful tool for handling another common type of
  messiness: when multiple variables crammed into a single column.
  Here you'll learn how to use `separate()` to pull out into their own columns.
  Note that the `sep` argument to `separate()` is a regular expression,
  which gives you a lot of power. You might also want to read about
  `extract()`: `str_split()` is to `separate()` as `str_match()` is to
  `extract().

  The inverse of `separate()` is `unite()`. You use it when you have a variable
  that is spread across multiple columns. This happen much less commonly.
