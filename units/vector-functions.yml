  Functions are powerful tool for reducing the amount of duplication in your
  code. Reducing duplicationg is a good principle because it means that
  each "fact" in your code is only stored in one place. When the requirements
  of your code change (as they invariably do), you only need to make the
  change in a single place, reducing the chances of inconsistencies within
  your code.

  To start with, we'll focus on functions that work with vectors. There
  are two common types:

  * Vectorised functions that return an output the same length as their
    input. You typically use these functions in `mutate()`.

  * Summary functions that return an output of length one. You typically
    use these functions with `summarise()`.
