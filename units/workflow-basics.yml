title: Data science workflow
desc: >
  Experience the full data science workflow by creating an RMarkdown file,
  running some R code, and uploading the results to GitHub. This is an
  authentic workflow: the only difference between this and what you'll use as
  a data scientist is that in this class you'll always show your code so
  we can give you feedback on the results _and_ the process.
