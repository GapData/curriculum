  Importing a file take places in two steps:

  1. The rectangular file is parsed into rows and columns. Each cell
     is a string.

  2. We try to parsed each into a more specific type, like numeric or date.

  It's easiest to learn import starting with step 2, because you can
  practice parsing character vectors with toy data in R. This will be helpful
  later when you encounter a weird file that needs special handling.
