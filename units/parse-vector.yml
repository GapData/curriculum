  Importing a file takes place in two steps:

  1. The rectangular file is parsed into rows and columns. Each cell
     is a string.

  2. We parse each column of strings into a more specific type, like
     numeric or date.

  For example, take the following (very simple) csv file:

  ```
  a,b,c
  x,4,5.4
  y,NA,7.2
  ```

  It's first parsed into individual cells, forming a tibble where each
  column is a character vector:

  ```R
  tibble(
    a = c("x", "y"),
    b = c("4", "NA"),
    c = c("5.4, "7.2")
  )
  ```

  Then, where possible, each column is parsed into a more specific type:

  ```R
  tibble(
    a = c("x", "y"),
    b = c(4L, NA),
    c = c(5.4, 7.2)
  )
  ```

  (The `L` suffix indicates that we have the integer 4, not the real
  number 4. You'll learn more about that later.)

  You'll learn import starting with step 2, because you can practice parsing
  character vectors with toy data in R. This will be helpful later when you
  encounter a weird file that needs special handling.
