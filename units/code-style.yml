title: Code style
theme: workflow

desc: |
  Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial.
  It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation
  can sure make things easier to read!

  For pipelines (including ggplot2 plots), I recommend putting each statement
  on a new line, ending each line with a `%>%` or `+` as appropriate.
  Each line that continues a pipe should be indented by two spaces.
  Include an empty line between different pipes and plots. Where possible
  give your pipes an informative name: this will help you remember their
  purpose when you come back to an analysis in the future.

    The specific style you follow is not as important as picking a consistent
    style and sticking to it. When you're working with others, it's a really
    good idea to share a common style so that everyone can easily read and
    write the code. In this class, we'll use the style guide from
    "Advanced R".
