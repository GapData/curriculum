title: Iteration

desc: |
  Functions allow you to eliminate one type of duplication. The tools
  of iteration, for loops and functional programming, allow you to eliminate
  another. It's good to understand how for loops work, but in this class
  we'll mostly focus on the `map()` functions from purrr.

needs: [lists, vector-functions]

    you should find this fairly straightforward, and you can just skim
    this section to see how R is different.
