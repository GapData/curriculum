title: Data manipulation basics
theme: wrangle

desc: |
  Some basic data manipulation is essential for many visualisations. Here
  you'll the learn the most important dplyr functions: `filter()`,
  `mutate()`, and `group_by()` + `summarise()`.

  Don't try and memorise the details of every verb, and the vector functions
  that you might use with them. Instead, focus on the big picture, and make
  sure you've familiarised yourself with the cheatsheet so that you can get
  the details (with `?`) when you need them.
