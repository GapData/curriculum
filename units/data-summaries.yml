title: Data summaries
tags: [wrangle]

desc: >
  Summary functions take a vector of data and return a single number. You
  Summary geoms divide the data into pieces, apply some summary and visualise
  the results. Summaries are useful when you have a lot of data (and plotting
  leads to overplotting), or when the data is noisy (and you need to make
  small but consistent patterns more clear).

    Not every summary function you need already exists. Sometimes you'll
    need to combine one or more existing summaries to compute what you
    want. While you can do this inline, it will make your code easier to
    use if you use small helper functions.

    The cheatsheet includes a list of the most important summary
    functions. Refer to it when you forget.

exercises:

- |
  Create a helper function to compute the coefficient of variation of a vector.
  Create a helper function to compute the proportion of missing values in
  a vector.

  To understand how airline delays vary daily over the course of a year, you
  need to summarise each day with a single number. Which variable should you
  use? Compare summaries using `mean()`, `median()`, and mean(x > cutoff)`.
  How do they differ? Which do you think is best?

- |
  Perhaps it's not actually the average delay that's most important, but
  the variability in the delays. What's a good summary?

- |
  Using the summary that you think is most appropriate, explore the average
  delay by destination. Explore the distribution of your summary. Can you
  explain the location with the 5 highest and 5 lowest values?

- |
  Sometimes the number or proportion of missing values can be extremely
  informative. Compute the proportion of flights missing departure times
  for each day. Visualise the results. What do missing values represent?
  How do they vary over the course of the year? How are they related to
  delays?
