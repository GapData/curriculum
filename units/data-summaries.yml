title: Grouped summaries

  Summary functions take a vector of data and return a single number.
  Summary geoms divide the data into pieces, apply some summary and visualise
  the results. Summaries are useful when you have a lot of data (and plotting
  leads to overplotting), or when the data is noisy (and you need to make
  small but consistent patterns more clear).

  Here we apply these tools to small (in-memory) data, but they're still
  useful when you have big (out-of-memory) data. That's because a powerful
  strategy for working with big data is to make it small with some combination
  of subsetting, summarising, or sampling.

    Familiarise yourself with the summary functions that you can use
    in conjunction with `summarise()`

    Read only section 3.5: compound geoms are conceptually the same as summary
    functions: they divide the data into groups and display a visual summary.
