title: Visual transformations
theme: explore

desc: >
  You've already learned about transformation functions that you use with
  `dplyr::mutate()`. They take one (or more) vectors and return a transformed
  vector of the same length. The ggplot2 equivalent of transformation
  functions are the scales. They take variables (numeric, character, ...)
  and convert them to visual properties (colour, shape, ...).

  Scales also control the axes and legends which help the reader understand
  the plot. Mastering this aspect of scales is important when creating plots
  for others to understand. We'll come back to this idea later.

    You can skip ยง6.3 and ยง6.4: we'll discuss them in detail when we talk
    more about plots for communication.
