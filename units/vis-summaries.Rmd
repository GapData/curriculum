```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

1.  What's gone wrong with this plot? Why is there only one boxplot?

    ```{r, warning = FALSE}
    library(nycflights13)
    
    flights <- mutate(flights, yday = lubridate::yday(time_hour))
    
    ggplot(flights, aes(yday, dep_delay)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    ```
      
    Explain the problem and give a solution that gives one boxplot for 
    each day of the year.
    
1.  Use the following three techniques to visualise the distribution of 
    delays by origin:
    
    * Frequency polygon + colour
    * Histogram + faceting
    * Side-by-side boxplots
    
    What are the pros and cons of each approach?

1.  Another useful summary is the beeswarm plot (which you can create with
    [ggbeeswarm](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm)). What makes them 
    different to the other summary geoms?
