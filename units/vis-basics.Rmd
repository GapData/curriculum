1.  Map a continuous variable to the color, size, and shape aesthetics.
    Map a categorical variable to the color, size, and shape aesthetics. 
    How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous?

1.  Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this plot? Why is there a weird legend?

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = 2))
    ```

1.  What do the dots (`.`) mean in the following ggplot2 commands? 
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```
