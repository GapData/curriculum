  Now that you know how to parse character vectors, you can learn how to
  parse complete files. This involves two new skills:

  * Figuring out which `read_` function corresponds to your file format.
    (If you're stuck, looking at the first few lines with
    `read_lines("path", n_max = 10))` is often helpful)

  * Understanding how readr's heuristics guess the type of each column,
    and how to translate you knowledge of the `parse_` functions to
    override those guesses when necessary.
