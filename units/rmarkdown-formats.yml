desc: |
  We only touched briefly on RMarkdown's capability to produce different
  forms of output. In this class you have used `github_document` which
  makes it very easy to publish your results on GitHub. The are two
  formats that you should know about:

  * `html_document`: this produces a stand-alone HTML document that you
    can easily share over email

  * ?????: this produces a HTML presentation which you can use when you
    need to present your data to a live audience

  * `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard`: this makes dashboards which can be
    convenient way to lay out multiple plots and tables on a single
    screen.
