title: Documentation

desc: |
  R comes with rich built-in documentation that you can access by typing
  `?` before the name of the function.  The documentation isn't always
  aimed at newcomers, and may use terminology that you're not familiar with.
  But don't despair! Ignore what you don't understand, and persevere.
  Often you'll find what you need in the examples at the file.

  There are three commands in R that you should be familiar with:

  * `?function_name` opens the help for `function_name()`.

  * `help(package = "package_name")` lists all the documentation available for
    a package.

  * `browseVignettes(package = "package_name")` lists all the "vignettes"
    (long form documentation) available for a package.

  There are also some useful websites that you'll learn about below.
