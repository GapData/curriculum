title: Vectors
desc: >
  The tidyverse functions that you've focussed on so far are holistic:
  they take a complete data frame and perform various transformations on it.
  However, when writing your own functions it's better to start vectors
  because they are much simpler. In this unit, you'll learn a bit
  about the underlying theory of vectors.

    learned more about lists.
