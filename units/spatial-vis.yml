  This currently requires the development version of ggplot2. You can
  install it from GitHub by using the devtools package:

  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  # install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
  ```

  (If you have an issues during the install, restart R so that you
  have a clean session. Installing ggplot2 is tricky if you already have it
  loaded!)
