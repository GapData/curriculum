title: RMarkdown basics
desc: >
  Experience the full data science workflow by creating an RMarkdown file that
  includes prose and code. __Knit__ the file to create intermingle your
  text and the results of the code. This is an authentic workflow: the only
  difference between this and what you'll use as a data scientist is that in
  this class you'll always show your code so we can give you feedback on the
  results _and_ the process.
