# Exploratory data analysis

Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and visualisation. This week you'll practice those tools by using them for EDA (exploratory data analysis), and diving into some of the details of dplyr and ggplot2 that we elided last week.
Here we apply these tools to small (in-memory) data, but they're still useful when you have big (out-of-memory) data. That's because a powerful strategy for working with big data is to make it small with some combination of subetting, summarising, or sampling.

## Exploratory data analysis

Exploratory data analysis is partly a set of techniques, but is mostly a mindset: you want to remain open to what the data is telling you. You'll learn the techniques in the readings, and then practice the mindset in class and in the challenges.
