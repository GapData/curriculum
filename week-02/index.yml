title: Exploratory data analysis

desc: >
  Good data analysis involves fluid transitions between transformation and
  visualisation. This week you'll practice those tools by using them for
  EDA (exploratory data analysis), and diving into some of the details of
  dplyr and ggplot2 that we elided last week.

  Here we apply these tools to small (in-memory) data, but they're still
  useful when you have big (out-of-memory) data. That's because a powerful
  strategy for working with big data is to make it small with some combination
  of subetting, summarising, or sampling.

    Exploratory data analysis is partly a set of techniques, but is mostly a
    mindset: you want to remain open to what the data is telling you.
    You'll learn the techniques in the readings, and then practice the
    mindset in class and in the challenges.

        This analysis by Todd W. Schneider uses R (along with other tools)
        to analyse over 20 million bike rides in NYC. As you read through
        the analysis think how you would do it yourself using the techniques you
        have learned so far.

        This analysis, also by Todd W. Schneider, uses much more data than
        the previous analysis. What additional challenges did Todd need to solve
        to allow him to work with this data?

    Now that you have some experience with dplyr, we'll fill in the blanks
    with a more sysematic exploration of the options.

    Now that you have some experience with ggplot2, we'll fill in the blanks
    with a more systematic exploration of the details. Read Chapters 4 and 5
    to get a better handle on the underyling theory (the Grammar of Graphics).
    Read Chapter 6 to learn how scales control the details of the mapping
    from data to visual properties.
